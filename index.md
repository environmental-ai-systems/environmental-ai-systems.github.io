# Environmental Modelling, Data & AI Systems Group

*A shared umbrella for environmental modelling, data science, and AI/LLM-enabled systems — with a strong emphasis on teaching, training, and reproducible research.*

---

## Remit
We bring together staff and students working across:
- **Environmental modelling** (process-based, statistical, hybrid)
- **Data science & analytics** (methods, workflows, reproducibility)
- **AI & LLM-enabled systems** (tools for analysis, synthesis, decision support)
- **Data/AI systems** (pipelines, evaluation, infrastructure, open resources)
- **Teaching & training** (courses, short workshops, skills development)

---

## Themes
- **Models & inference:** calibration, uncertainty, emulation, scenarios
- **Data & methods:** QA/QC, integration, spatiotemporal methods
- **AI systems:** LLM tooling, retrieval, evaluation, human-in-the-loop workflows
- **Open research:** reusable code, transparent methods, collaborative practice
